Making the Windows Desktop Experience a bit more interesting... and hopefully effective!
------------------

Icons
---------

Main Sections this will include will be the icon directory, where I have compliled a number of '.ico' files to make that ugly, boring file explorer a bit more fun to look at.

Not to mention, it is easier to stay organized and to find the directories that are being searched


Registry
-------
Future plans for cleaning up the disgusting context menu editor and making it more efficient for each individual's workspace:

These plans will include PowerShellh, .bat, and other scripts scripts to automate the process.

## Disclaimer
You must read and understand what the code does before executing -- I take not responsibility for ruining others machines due to my lack of programming skills!

**YOU REALLY SHOULD DOUBLE CHECK IN SANDBOX FIRST**

1. Context Menu Editor
2. Shortcuts to Applications
3. Automate borning tasks

and most importantly...

4. Make it look pretty!

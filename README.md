Making the Windows Desktop Experience a bit more interesting... and hopefully effective!
------------------

Fonts
------------
Some additional font types and families will be available, mostly those from UNIX distributions.

* Open Sans

Icons
---------

Main point of this repository is to store and add *.ico* files that can be used to customize file icons and folders to make that ugly, boring file explorer a bit more fun to look at.

Not to mention, it is easier to stay organized and to find the directories that are being searched.

Installers
-------------
* Links to programs, tools, and suites for download
* Compressed files of the actualy executables



Powershell
-----------

* customize powershell color schemes
* turn on and off windows features
* WSl assistance
* task automation
* package management (chocolately)
* program download and installation



Registry
-------
Future plans for cleaning up the disgusting context menu editor and making it more efficient for each individual's workspace:

These plans will include PowerShell, .bat, and other scripts scripts to automate the process.

Disclaimer
------------
You must read and understand what the code does before executing -- I take not responsibility for ruining others machines due to my lack of programming skills!

**YOU REALLY SHOULD DOUBLE CHECK IN SANDBOX FIRST**

1. Context Menu Editor

2. Shortcuts to Applications

3. Automate boring tasks and most importantly...

4. Make it look pretty!

... and there will be more i just don't got the time right now
